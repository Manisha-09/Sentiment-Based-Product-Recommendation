# Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a product recommendation system that leverages sentiment analysis to suggest products based on customer reviews. By analyzing the sentiment of product reviews, the system provides personalized recommendations that better align with customer preferences, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises customer reviews, including text reviews, ratings, and product details. This rich dataset allows for the analysis of sentiment and its correlation with product preferences.

## Key Features
- **Customer Reviews**: Textual reviews from customers that are analyzed for sentiment.
- **Product Ratings**: Numerical ratings that help in understanding customer satisfaction.
- **Product Information**: Details about the products being reviewed, such as category and brand.

## Models and Techniques
- **Sentiment Analysis using NLP**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including TF-IDF and Word2Vec, were used to process and analyze customer reviews.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Used to recommend products based on the sentiment-driven preferences of similar users.
